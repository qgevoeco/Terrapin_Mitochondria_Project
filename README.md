# Terrapin_Mitochondria_Project
Sequence assembly and variant calling for diamondback terrapin mitochondrial genome

### This is the pipeline used to generate consensus sequences, alignments, and call variants for the mitochondrial genome of the diamondback terrapin (malaclemys terrapin)

## Scripts to be run are as follows

1) Mitochondrial alignment.sh

2) Mpileup_Variant_calling.sh
